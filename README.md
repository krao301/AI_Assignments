## 1.Maze Solving using A* Search Algorithm
- Maze is represented using a 2D Array
- In the Maze matrix, 1 means the block is a dead end and 0 means the block can be used in the path from source to destination.
- Shortest path between any two points in the maze is found using [astar2.py](https://github.com/krao301/AI_Assignments/blob/main/assignment%201/astar2.py)
